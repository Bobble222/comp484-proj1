      <p>Like any living being, dogs require maintenance to live. To be a proper owner, you need to not only fill their basic needs of food and water, but should also strive to fulfill their social needs of playing with other dogs if possible, and enrichment through toys. You also need to be prepared for the financial burden, since while there is the costs of food and water to take take care of them, there will likely be at least one instance in their lifetime where you need to take them to the vet, which is expensive.  It is important to take these responsibilities seriously before going down the path of dog ownership.</p>
